Note also some other options:

- [InstantSheller](http://www.gameex.com/Community/InstantShellerandShellingGuide.aspx)
- [CursorHider.exe](http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php/topic,43724.msg408935.html#msg408935)

Making it disspear entirely may be a bit much. You might just want to have a very small dot. Here are a couple of cursors to try:
