#JoySwitch#

Need a joycable interface for Tobii Communicator but don't have one? Then you need me!

## What does this do? ##
Some applications need/require a switch interface but are looking for a joystick interface. Such applications include Tobii Communicator and using a switch to select. (Tobii Communicator can use a range of other switch actions for scanning but not eyegaze selection.)

## How to use it ##

1. Download and install [vJoy](sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/files/latest/download) (You don't need the "feeder application" when you install it)
3. Download the [JoySwitch application](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/script-exes/JoySwitch.exe)
4. Double Click! To exit the application right click on the little umbrella in your tool bar and click "exit:
5. Map your switch box to 0 for your single switch (1,2 are second and third switches)


## If you want to edit this ##

1. Download the AHK file from this repo above.
2. Download the [AHK vJoy Wrapper](https://github.com/evilC/AHK-Universal-Joystick-Remapper) - so and place the JoySwitch AHK file in the folder above the vJoyLib directory..
3. Run or compile with the AHK compiler
