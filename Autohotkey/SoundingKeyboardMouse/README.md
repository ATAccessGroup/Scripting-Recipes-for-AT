#Keyboard Sounder#

![](https://github.com/willwade/Scripting-Recipes-for-AT/raw/master/Autohotkey/SoundingKeyboardMouse/icon.png)

This is a little Windows system tray app to produce keyboard sounds on each keyboard press. Inspired by [this commercial app (KeySound)](http://www.softboy.net/keysound/) which does much more. 
 
##To use:##

1. Download it [here](http://wllw.de/KsRdiX). Unzip it. Feel free to run it from your desktop or wherever - even a USB stick will do.
2. Place your KeySounds (as wav files) in your My Documents/KeySounds directory. E.g. 1.wav, 2.wav, k.wav etc..
3. When Run you should here the sounds played. 

###Caveats:###

- Only letters a-z and 0-9 can have sound files associated. It can't tell whether its upper or lower case
- Sounds need to be as .wav files

###Developer Notes###

The code is written rather quickly in [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) by [will wade](http://willwa.de) you can take a look at the [source code here](https://github.com/willwade/Scripting-Recipes-for-AT/tree/master/Autohotkey/SoundingKeyboardMouse) and you are more than welcome to fork the code and adapt for your own needs.
