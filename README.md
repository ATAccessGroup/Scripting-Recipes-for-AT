Scripting-Recipes-for-AT
========================

Little Apps and Scripts that have been collected. 

Scripts are organised depending on the language/scripting tool used. Granted - we could organise these a little better/differently depending on your need but hey - its better than just one big folder right? OK maybe not..

What follows is a kind of Index:

###Autohotkey###
- FilterMouseClicks. Filters the mouse presses. 
- HideMouse. A little demonstration of hiding the mouse - potentially useful for eyegaze
- KeyboardDebouncer. A useful debouncer script
- MouseKeys. Use the arrow keys to control the mouse. 
- MusicSwitcher. Listens to a switch/switches and controls the playing of music/video in VLC/iTunes or WMP. 
- Numpad2Text. Imagine a T9 Keyboard using the number pad. 
- OneButtonMouse. Turn a two button mouse into a one button one. 
- OneSwitchTwoActions. Send two Keyboard actions with one switch (keyboard) press. 
- SoundingKeyboardMouse. Plays a different sound for each keyboard press. 

###Processing###
- circleArt. A little demo really - some of the eyegaze/cause and effect apps are easily created. 

###Python###
- SoundingKeyboardMouse.py - See above. 

###VB/RegEdit###
- FilterKeyScripts - Sets the filterkey times using a regedit script. 
- ToggleProxy.vbs - Useful for schools with students taking their laptops between home and school. Switches the Web Proxy on/off.
